    Performance notes
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Optimizing database write throughput and responsiveness is done by
    configuring and scheduling work and checkpoint operations, and by
    configuring a few other parameters.

    * ``autocheckpoint``, default=2048 in KB, or 2MB

      Controls how often the database is checkpointed. Increasing this value
      to 8MB may improve overall write throughput.

    * ``autoflush``, default=1024 in KB, or 1MB

      Determines how much data, in KB, is allowed to accumulate in the live
      in-memory tree before the tree is marked as "old". The default, 1024K,
      may be increased to improve overall write throughput. Decreasing this
      value reduces memory usage.

    * ``automerge``, default=4 segments

      If auto-work is enabled, then this option is set to the number of
      segments that the library attempts to merge simultaneously. Increasing
      this value may reduce the total amount of data written to the database
      file. Decreasing it has the opposite effect and also decreases the
      average number of segments in the file, which may improve reads.

      The default value is 4, but may be set to any value between 2 and 8.

    * ``autowork``, enabled by default

      Let the database determine when to perform checkpoints, as a part of
      calls to insert(), delete(), or commit(). If set to 0 (false), then
      the application must schedule these operations.

    * ``mmap``, enabled by default on 64-bit systems

      If LSM is running on 64-bit system, mmap may be set to 1 or 0. On
      32-bit systems mmap is always 0.

      If enabled, the entire database file is memory mapped. If false, data
      is accessed using the OS file primitives. Memory mapping can
      significantly improve the performance of read operations, as pages do
      not have to be copied from OS buffers into user space.

    * ``multiple_processes``, enabled by default

      If set to 0 (false) the library does not use file-locking primitives
      to lock the database, which speeds up transactions. This option is
      enabled by default.

    * ``write_safety``, default=1

      This option determines how often the library pauses to wait for data
      written to the file-system to be synced. Since syncing is much slower
      than simply copying data into OS buffers, this option has a large
      effect on write performance. See set_write_safety() for more info.

    * ``transaction_log``, enabled by default

      This option determines whether the db will write changes to a log
      file. If disabled, writes will be faster but there is a chance for
      data loss in the event of application crash or power failure. Option
      is enabled by default.

    The speed of database read operations is largely determined by the number
    of segments in the database file. So optimizing read operations is also
    linked to the configuring and scheduling of database write operations, as
    these policies determine the number of segments that are present in the
    database file at any time.

            >>> db[:'x']
            [('a', 'A'), ('c', 'C'), ('d', 'D'), ('f', 'F')]

        If the start key is higher than the highest key, no results are
        returned.

        .. code-block:: pycon

            >>> db['x':]

        If one of the boundaries is not specified (``None``), then it will
        start at the highest and lowest keys, respectively.

        .. code-block:: pycon
