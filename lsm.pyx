    #   option in KB. If it is, and there is not already an old in-memory tree,
    #   the live in-memory tree is marked as old.

    #     0 (off):    No robustness. A system crash may corrupt the database.

    #   the database file.
    #
    #   The amount of uncheckpointed data already written to the database file
    #   is a global parameter. After performing database work (writing to the
    #   database file), the process checks if the total amount of uncheckpointed
    #   data exceeds the value of this paramter. If so, a checkpoint is performed.
    #   This means that this option may cause the connection to perform a
    #   checkpoint even if the current connection has itself written very little

    #   to by the third parameter is set to the number of 4KB pages written to
    #   the database file during the lifetime of this connection.
    #
    # LSM_INFO_NREAD:
    #   The third parameter should be of type (int *). The location pointed
    #   to by the third parameter is set to the number of 4KB pages read from
    #   the database file during the lifetime of this connection.
    #
    # LSM_INFO_DB_STRUCTURE:
    #   The third argument should be of type (char **). The location pointed
    #   to is populated with a pointer to a nul-terminated string containing
    #   the string representation of a Tcl data-structure reflecting the
    #   current structure of the database file. Specifically, the current state
    #   of the worker snapshot. The returned string should be eventually freed
    #   by the caller using lsm_free().
    #
    #   The returned list contains one element for each level in the database,
    #   in order from most to least recent. Each element contains a
    #   single element for each segment comprising the corresponding level,
    #   starting with the lhs segment, then each of the rhs segments (if any)
    #   in order from most to least recent.
    #
    #   Each segment element is itself a list of 4 integer values, as follows:
    #
    #   <ol><li> First page of segment
    #       <li> Last page of segment
    #       <li> Root page of segment (if applicable)
    #       <li> Total number of pages in segment
    #   </ol>
    #
    # LSM_INFO_ARRAY_STRUCTURE:
    #   There should be two arguments passed following this option (i.e. a
    #   total of four arguments passed to lsm_info()). The first argument
    #   should be the page number of the first page in a database array
    #   (perhaps obtained from an earlier INFO_DB_STRUCTURE call). The second
    #   trailing argument should be of type (char **). The location pointed
    #   to is populated with a pointer to a nul-terminated string that must
    #   be eventually freed using lsm_free() by the caller.
    #
    #   The output string contains the text representation of a Tcl list of
    #   integers. Each pair of integers represent a range of pages used by
    #   the identified array. For example, if the array occupies database
    #   pages 993 to 1024, then pages 2048 to 2777, then the returned string
    #   will be "993 1024 2048 2777".
    #
    #   If the specified integer argument does not correspond to the first
    #   page of any database array, LSM_ERROR is returned and the output
    #   pointer is set to a NULL value.
    #
    # LSM_INFO_LOG_STRUCTURE:
    #   The third argument should be of type (char **). The location pointed
    #   to is populated with a pointer to a nul-terminated string containing
    #   the string representation of a Tcl data-structure. The returned
    #   string should be eventually freed by the caller using lsm_free().
    #
    #   The Tcl structure returned is a list of six integers that describe
    #   the current structure of the log file.
    #
    # LSM_INFO_ARRAY_PAGES:
    #
    # LSM_INFO_PAGE_ASCII_DUMP:
    #   As with LSM_INFO_ARRAY_STRUCTURE, there should be two arguments passed
    #   with calls that specify this option - an integer page number and a
    #   (char **) used to return a nul-terminated string that must be later
    #   freed using lsm_free(). In this case the output string is populated
    #   with a human-readable description of the page content.
    #
    #   If the page cannot be decoded, it is not an error. In this case the
    #   human-readable output message will report the systems failure to
    #   interpret the page data.
    #
    # LSM_INFO_PAGE_HEX_DUMP:
    #   This argument is similar to PAGE_ASCII_DUMP, except that keys and
    #   values are represented using hexadecimal notation instead of ascii.
    #
    # LSM_INFO_FREELIST:
    #   The third argument should be of type (char **). The location pointed
    #   to is populated with a pointer to a nul-terminated string containing
    #   the string representation of a Tcl data-structure. The returned
    #   string should be eventually freed by the caller using lsm_free().
    #
    #   The Tcl structure returned is a list containing one element for each
    #   free block in the database. The element itself consists of two
    #   integers - the block number and the id of the snapshot that freed it.
    #
    # LSM_INFO_CHECKPOINT_SIZE:
    #   The third argument should be of type (int *). The location pointed to
    #   by this argument is populated with the number of KB written to the
    #   database file since the most recent checkpoint.
    #
    # LSM_INFO_TREE_SIZE:
    #   If this value is passed as the second argument to an lsm_info() call, it
    #   should be followed by two arguments of type (int *) (for a total of four
    #   arguments).
    #
    #   At any time, there are either one or two tree structures held in shared
    #   memory that new database clients will access (there may also be additional
    #   tree structures being used by older clients - this API does not provide
    #   information on them). One tree structure - the current tree - is used to
    #   accumulate new data written to the database. The other tree structure -
    #   the old tree - is a read-only tree holding older data and may be flushed
    #   to disk at any time.
    #
    #   Assuming no error occurs, the location pointed to by the first of the two
    #   (int *) arguments is set to the size of the old in-memory tree in KB.
    #   The second is set to the size of the current, or live in-memory tree.
    #
    # LSM_INFO_COMPRESSION_ID:
    #   This value should be followed by a single argument of type
    #   (unsigned int *). If successful, the location pointed to is populated
    #   with the database compression id before returning.

    # depends on the value passed as the final parameter, as follows:
    #
    # LSM_SEEK_EQ:
    #   The cursor is left at EOF (invalidated). A call to lsm_csr_valid()

    #   The cursor is left pointing to the largest key in the database that

    # in the database that is less than or equal to (pKey/nKey).

        If the start key is higher than the highest key, no results are
        returned.

        .. code-block:: pycon
